🎠 Review Carousel

A simple and modern review carousel built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project showcases multiple user profiles with smooth navigation using Next and Back buttons.
It’s designed as a clean UI component that can be used for testimonials, team highlights, or profile previews.

This project also helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, arrays of objects, and responsive design in JavaScript.
